John MacArthur  
Disposable universe  
False teacher: lust, sensual, Indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, unreasoning animals, count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. In their deception as they carouse with you. Full of adultery, never cease from sin, love the wage of unrighteousness. Speak arrogant words of vanity. Slave of corruption  
Accountability, supernature judgment
