## What steal our joy?
### Manage our mind
* Travel to the past: bitterness, unforgiven
* Travel to the future: worry
* Travel to the Lord Jesus Christ

### Sin rips off our joy
* 我闭口不认罪的时候， 因终日唉哼而骨头枯干。  黑夜白日，你的手在我身上沉重； 我的精液耗尽，如同夏天的干旱。 （细拉）
诗篇 32:3‭-‬4 For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.  For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah
* Behold, the Lord ’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;   but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.
Isaiah 59:1‭-‬2 耶和华的膀臂并非缩短，不能拯救， 耳朵并非发沉，不能听见，  但你们的罪孽使你们与　神隔绝； 你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。
