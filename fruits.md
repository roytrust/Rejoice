原来基督的爱激励我们；因我们想，一人既替众人死，众人就都死了； 并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。
哥林多后书 5:14‭-‬15
For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. 2 Corinthians 5:14‭-‬15
