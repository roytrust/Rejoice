### Sir Francis Bacon 培根
> “科学方法之父”培根说过,“有两本书作我们指导的指南针，以免我们误入歧途。第一本书是启示神旨意的《圣经》，第二本书则是展现神能力的自然界。”
> Sir Francis was a devout believer in the Bible. He wrote: “There are two books laid before us to study, to prevent our falling into error; first, the volume of the Scriptures, which reveal the will of God; then the volume of the Creatures, which express His power.”

### Galileo 伽利略
> In a letter explaining his views on the mixture of science and religion, Galileo wrote: Holy Scripture could never lie or err, but its decrees are of absolute and inviolable truth. I should only have added that although Scripture can indeed not err, nevertheless some of its interpreters and expositors may sometimes err in various ways, one of which may be very serious and quite frequent, [that is,] when they would base themselves always on the literal meaning of words.  
> 意大利科学家伽利略坚持“《圣经》不容妥协”。在一封解释他的科学、宗教观的信中，写道：
>《圣经》并不说谎、或者有错，它的道理是绝对和不可侵犯的真理。我只能说，即使《圣经》无误，但有些解经家和解释的人在许多地方时有误解。当他们往往只是撷取文字表面意义时，有些错误就显得非常严重，而且经常一误再误。
