太初有道，道与　神同在，道就是　神。 这道太初与　神同在。 万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。
约翰福音 1:1‭-‬3 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.

It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. John 6:63
叫人活着的乃是灵，肉体是无益的。我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。
