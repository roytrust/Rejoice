太初有道，道与　神同在，道就是　神。 这道太初与　神同在。 万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。
约翰福音 1:1‭-‬3 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.

It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. John 6:63
叫人活着的乃是灵，肉体是无益的。我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。

Consider how I love your precepts!  Give me life according to your steadfast love.   The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures forever.   Princes persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of your words.  I rejoice at your word like one who finds great spoil. Psalm 119:159‭-‬162
你看我怎样爱你的训词！ 耶和华啊，求你照你的慈爱将我救活！  你话的总纲是真实； 你一切公义的典章是永远长存。  首领无故地逼迫我， 但我的心畏惧你的言语。  我喜爱你的话， 好像人得了许多掳物。

耶和华的律法全备，能苏醒人心； 耶和华的法度确定，能使愚人有智慧。  耶和华的训词正直，能快活人的心； 耶和华的命令清洁，能明亮人的眼目。  耶和华的道理洁净，存到永远； 耶和华的典章真实，全然公义—  都比金子可羡慕，且比极多的精金可羡慕； 比蜜甘甜，且比蜂房下滴的蜜甘甜。  况且你的仆人因此受警戒， 守着这些便有大赏。
诗篇 19:7‭-‬11
The law of the Lord is perfect,  reviving the soul;  the testimony of the Lord is sure,  making wise the simple;   the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure,  enlightening the eyes;  the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.  More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold;  sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.  Moreover, by them is your servant warned;  in keeping them there is great reward.

How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word.   With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments!  I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.  Blessed are you, O Lord ;  teach me your statutes!  With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth.  In the way of your testimonies I delight as much as in all riches.  I will meditate on your precepts and fix my eyes on your ways.  I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word.
Psalm 119:9‭-‬16
少年人用什么洁净他的行为呢？ 是要遵行你的话！  我一心寻求了你； 求你不要叫我偏离你的命令。  我将你的话藏在心里， 免得我得罪你。  耶和华啊，你是应当称颂的！ 求你将你的律例教训我！  我用嘴唇传扬你口中的一切典章。  我喜悦你的法度， 如同喜悦一切的财物。  我要默想你的训词， 看重你的道路。  我要在你的律例中自乐； 我不忘记你的话。

耶和华—万军之　神啊， 我得着你的言语就 当食物 吃了； 你的言语是我心中的欢喜快乐， 因我是称为你名下的人。
耶利米书 15:16 
Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart,  for I am called by your name, O Lord , God of hosts.
