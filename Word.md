太初有道，道与　神同在，道就是　神。 这道太初与　神同在。 万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。
约翰福音 1:1‭-‬3 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.

It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. John 6:63
叫人活着的乃是灵，肉体是无益的。我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。

Consider how I love your precepts!  Give me life according to your steadfast love.   The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures forever.   Princes persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of your words.  I rejoice at your word like one who finds great spoil. Psalm 119:159‭-‬162
你看我怎样爱你的训词！ 耶和华啊，求你照你的慈爱将我救活！  你话的总纲是真实； 你一切公义的典章是永远长存。  首领无故地逼迫我， 但我的心畏惧你的言语。  我喜爱你的话， 好像人得了许多掳物。

耶和华的律法全备，能苏醒人心； 耶和华的法度确定，能使愚人有智慧。  耶和华的训词正直，能快活人的心； 耶和华的命令清洁，能明亮人的眼目。  耶和华的道理洁净，存到永远； 耶和华的典章真实，全然公义—  都比金子可羡慕，且比极多的精金可羡慕； 比蜜甘甜，且比蜂房下滴的蜜甘甜。  况且你的仆人因此受警戒， 守着这些便有大赏。
诗篇 19:7‭-‬11
The law of the Lord is perfect,  reviving the soul;  the testimony of the Lord is sure,  making wise the simple;   the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure,  enlightening the eyes;  the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.  More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold;  sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.  Moreover, by them is your servant warned;  in keeping them there is great reward.
