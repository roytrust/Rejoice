深哉，　神丰富的智慧和知识！ 他的判断何其难测！ 他的踪迹何其难寻！  谁知道主的心？ 谁作过他的谋士呢？  谁是先给了他， 使他后来偿还呢？  因为万有都是本于他， 倚靠他，归于他。 愿荣耀归给他，直到永远。阿们！
罗马书 11:33‭-‬36  
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! "For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?" "Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?" For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.
Romans 11:33‭-‬36
