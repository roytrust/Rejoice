## 永恒与暂时 Eternal vs temporal
* God is eternal
* 不朽, 可朽坏的
* 和神连接, 才可以永恒
* 凡经不起时间考验的，都是暂时的，没有永恒的意义。
* 暂时如果可以和神连接，可以产生永恒的意义。
* 时间这个维度是要结束的。但是超越了时间维度，并不一定进入永恒，也可能进入永死。和神连接才能进入永恒，永生。


我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀。 原来我们不是顾念所见的，乃是顾念所不见的；因为所见的是暂时的，所不见的是永远的。哥林多后书 4:17‭-‬18 
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal. II Corinthians 4:17‭-‬18 NKJV

to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; Romans 2:7 凡恒心行善、寻求荣耀、尊贵和不能朽坏 之福 的，就以永生报应他们；罗马书 2:7

愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神！他曾照自己的大怜悯，借耶稣基督从死里复活，重生了我们，叫我们有活泼的盼望， 可以得着不能朽坏、不能玷污、不能衰残、为你们存留在天上的基业。 你们这因信蒙　神能力保守的人，必能得着所预备、到末世要显现的救恩。 因此，你们是大有喜乐；但如今，在百般的试炼中暂时忧愁， 叫你们的信心既被试验，就比那被火试验仍然能坏的金子更显宝贵，可以在耶稣基督显现的时候得着称赞、荣耀、尊贵。
彼得前书 1:3‭-‬7
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:3‭-‬7
