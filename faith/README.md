### [唐崇荣牧师](tang.md)
* 圣灵最大的工作，是把道带到人间。Common groud.
* 旧约隐藏着新约，新约应验了旧约的应许。
* 普遍恩典，救赎恩典 common grace, saving grace
* Man is what he reacts to God.
* 不可能、不信、有限的经验，限制和捆绑人，甚至试图捆绑神的道和真理。越多错误的经验，越多的捆绑。
* 把人的有限，放到神的无限，丰盛就出来了。人越分越少，神越分越多。神给我们的恩赐，是否交给神，让神管理? 交在主手里。
* 主的工作，主给我们机会看他工作
* 基督作救主的资格: 神差的(神的权柄、原理、工作、记号、能力)，神的原理(超时间、超空间、全世审判官)
* the future is now, here is there, once is forever.


### John MacArthur
* Satan/demons operate a kingdom of lies that dominates the world.
* spiritual war, battle for how people think, the mind. Not about chasing Satan away. The world is imprisoned in belief systems.

### St. Augustine
* Thou hast made us for thyself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it finds its rest in thee.
* To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek him the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement.
* There is no saint without a past, no sinner without a future.
* Miracles are not contrary to nature but only contrary to what we know about nature.
* The truth is like a lion; you don’t have to defend it. Let it loose; it will defend itself.
* God is always trying to give good things to us, but our hands are too full to receive them.
* How can the past and future be, when the past no longer is, and the future is not yet? As for the present, if it were always present and never moved on to become the past, it would not be time, but eternity.
* Christ is not valued at all, unless he is valued above all.
* There can only be two basic loves... the love of God unto the forgetfulness of self, or the love of self unto the forgetfulness and denial of God.
* Oh, God, to know you is life. To serve You is freedom. To praise you is the soul's joy and delight. Guard me with the power of Your grace here and in all places. Now and at all times, forever. Amen.
